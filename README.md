# Loop Tempo Overlap Calculator

Are you, like me, in some musical situation where you need to change tempos in a song but your looping technology only offers one tempo without stopping and starting over? You're in luck! This tool will calculate where your new tempo overlaps your old one, and if it doesn't, will suggest a new tempo within a tolerance you provide. You also get the amount of repeats you can do and how much the generated tempo deviates from the one you had in mind.

Tempo A: This is the tempo you don't want to change; the tempo of the rest of the song.

Time Sig. A: The time signature of Tempo A. You can enter wacky values like 4/7 and it will still be correct.

Tempo B: The tempo to be changed in order to fit your loop into an integer repetition of Tempo A. Better results are achieved when Tempo A is higher than Tempo B.

Time Sig. B: The time signature of Tempo B (the part with the loop).

Loop Length: The length of the loop, in measures of Tempo B.

Repeats: How many times the loop repeats in the section of the song.

Tolerance: The percentage of change in bpm (up or down) from Tempo B you are willing to accept for the new tempo. Low values will not likely result in any viable tempos and high values will provide too many and will likely change your part too much. 5 to 10% is usually the sweet spot.
